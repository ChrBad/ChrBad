## 👋 Hey, I'm Chris

I've been building software for twenty years because I love creating tools to support people in their tasks or simplify those tasks. What I enjoy most is not just the coding part—it's the whole journey from "what do people actually need?" through design, architecture, and into working software that makes their lives easier.

I'm grateful for the fundamentals I learned in technical college—developing in everything from Turbo Pascal to C/C++ and Java. But I settled on web technologies because that's where the best user experience happens.

*My motto: When you have do something, why not make it at least a bit fun?*

### 🛠️ How I Work

- **Full-stack**: PHP/Laravel, PostgreSQL, JavaScript — building everything from database design to UI
- **Design-first**: ER diagrams, user stories, upfront planning (not exhaustive, but intentional) — creating a sustainable base for the overall software objectives
- **Methodical**: Diagrams, documentation, proper architecture — because good design never goes out of style
- **Pragmatic**: Work in short iterations where possible—getting prototypes out as fast as possible
- **AI-assisted**: Leverage different models as virtual buddy — speeding up concept phase, mock-ups, coding and documentation tasks

### 💡 What Drives Me

The transition from "ugh, that's awfully annoying" to "hey, that's actually pretty cool!" The architecture decisions. Watching something go from concept to working software. I love the entire cycle: understanding the problem, designing the system, building the database, writing the code, shipping the product.

My current project is **[Horrea Concept](https://horrea.io)**—professional warehouse technology assessment software. It combines everything I'm passionate about: systematic problem-solving, clean design, and building tools that help people make better decisions on projects that actually matter.

### ❓ One thing I'd emphasize

**Database design matters.** If you work in environments where databases are involved, it's crucial to understand that how you store your data significantly impacts how you work with it down the line. Database design is important—not something that should just happen by accident.
